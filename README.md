# queueing_simulation
Generate interarrival, service and waiting times for general FCFS open queueing networks. Each node consists of single queue-server pair.

Interrival and Service distributions can be exponential or lognormal. In case of lognormal interarrival times, these can further be chosen to be correlated.
